# Wallpaper Arts - Creative Coding Playground üé®

Welcome to my creative coding journey! This is my personal collection of canvas-sketch.js experiments where I explore digital art, generative design, and visual programming. I'm passionate about combining code with creativity to produce unique wallpapers and artistic compositions.

**Join the Creative Journey!** ‚ú®  
I encourage fellow developers and artists to fork this repository, experiment with the code, and share your own creative interpretations. Let's build a community of creative coders together! Stay tuned as I'll be adding more diverse creative coding projects beyond wallpapers in the future.

## üéØ What You'll Find Here

This repository showcases various creative coding experiments, currently focusing on digital wallpaper generation. Each project demonstrates different techniques in generative art, from binary patterns and glitch effects to geometric compositions and interactive color schemes.

## üé® Projects Included

### 1. Binary Hello World Poster (`binary-hello-world-poster.js`)
A high-contrast, monochrome typographic art poster featuring the binary code for "Hello, World!" arranged in flowing lines with digital glitch effects.

**Features:**
- Diagonal split composition (white/black sections)
- Dense binary coverage with glitch effects
- High-resolution vector-style output
- Vintage terminal styling

### 2. PC Wallpaper (`pc_wallpaper.js`)
A dynamic 4K wallpaper generator featuring binary dragon artwork with customizable backgrounds.

**Features:**
- 4K resolution (3840x2160)
- Binary bitmap dragon rendering
- Zigzag binary pattern backgrounds
- 3D tilted watermark effects
- Sharp diagonal composition

### 3. Legendary Saying (`legendary-saying.js`)
An artistic poster with angled backgrounds and customizable color schemes.

**Features:**
- Collapsible tweak panel for real-time color adjustments
- A4 landscape format at 300 DPI
- Three-section angled design
- Modern typography effects

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- canvas-sketch CLI (for running the creative coding projects)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone this creative playground:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/u2204125/creative-coding.git
cd creative-coding
```

2. **Install canvas-sketch globally using pnpm:**
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install -g canvas-sketch-cli
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pnpm install
```

> **Why pnpm?** We use pnpm instead of npm because it's faster, more efficient with disk space (uses symlinks), handles peer dependencies better, and has stricter dependency resolution that prevents version conflicts. Perfect for creative coding projects with multiple canvas-sketch dependencies!

### Running Any Project

The beauty of this setup is its simplicity - each `.js` file is a standalone creative coding experiment:

```bash
# Run any creative project interactively
canvas-sketch [filename].js

# Export high-quality renders
canvas-sketch [filename].js --output=exports/[name].png --export
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for experimentation)
canvas-sketch src/pc_wallpaper.js
canvas-sketch src/legendary-saying.js

# Direct export mode
canvas-sketch src/pc_wallpaper.js --output=my-wallpaper.png --export
```

- **Output**: High-quality PNG/PDF export

## üöÄ Local Development

For local testing, you can use any static file server:
```bash
# Python (if you have it)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node.js alternative
npx serve .

# VS Code Live Server extension (recommended)
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/gallery/` to view your gallery locally.
